##HTTP CALL 
Status codes are a useful HTTP construct that provide information to the consumer about the outcome of a request and how to interpret it. 
For example, if I were to make a request to retrieve a file from a web server, I would expect to see a response with the status code describing whether or not my request was completed successfully.
If not, the status code would give me a further clue as to why my request failed
