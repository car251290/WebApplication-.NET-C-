.Net and C# using RestApis

## HTTP CALL 
Status codes are a useful HTTP construct that provide information to the consumer about the outcome of a request and how to interpret it. 
For example, if I were to make a request to retrieve a file from a web server, I would expect to see a response with the status code describing whether or not my request was completed successfully.
If not, the status code would give me a further clue as to why my request failed
HTTP is not just for serving up web pages. HTTP is also a powerful platform for building APIs that expose services and data. HTTP is simple, flexible, and ubiquitous. Almost any platform that you can think of has an HTTP library, so HTTP services can reach a broad range of clients, including browsers, mobile devices, and traditional desktop applications.


## Model 
Adding a Model
A model is an object that represents the data in your application. ASP.NET Web API can automatically serialize your model to JSON, XML, or some other format, and then write the serialized data into the body of the HTTP response message

## controller 

Adding a Controller
In Web API, a controller is an object that handles HTTP requests. We'll add a controller that can return either a list of products or a single product specified by ID.

## View 
Adding the view controller using HTML and displaying the object of my controller so it will become easer to see display it in the application.

## Methods 

REST on top of HTTP, and how it leverages the resource based nature of the Web to design simple and scalable web services. Find it here!

## client 

Run in the JS file using HTML and CSS for display it on the HTML and in the CSS for the front end of the project
